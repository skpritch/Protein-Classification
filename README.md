# Protein-Classification
• Compiled a dataset of 1,000 proteins across 10 membrane-expressing classes; curated FASTA sequences and PDB structures for feature engineering. • Achieved 94.5% classification accuracy with classical ML models; demonstrated their robustness over deep-learning algorithms in data-scarce environments.
